When we gave this workshop, we asked the audience "What kind of APIs do you hope exist, or know exist and want to know more about?", and asked them to discuss ideas with their neighbors. This is an annotated version of the answers we got, with our comments in bold.  
  
  
Book data  
Dog Tinder  
NOAA  
I want to make Twitter bots  
> **Great! We have [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/WPRDC/api-training/blob/master/twitter_bot_demo.ipynb) to get you started.**  

Lead pipes in the area  
Sensor data from cars  
What does Google know about me?  
Mascots  
Info about animal hybrids  
Air quality  
> **We actually have a [sample notebook about using WPRDC data on local air quality](https://github.com/WPRDC/Jupyter-notebooks-by-dataset/blob/master/air-quality-exploration.ipynb), too. Another great resource is the Environmental Protection Agency's [AirNow site](https://www.airnow.gov/) which has [an API](https://docs.airnowapi.org/) that lets you pull historical air-quality measurements, current measurements, forecasts by ZIP code or latitude/longitude, and even contour maps of air quality.  

Restaurants data  
Happy hours  
Census & federal data  
Air quality  
Deliver me food  
Fire calls  
Library history  
Ticketing systems  
Mine Google searches  
Pittsburgh start-ups  
Voter registration  
Weather (x2)  
> **There's a bunch of APIs that will give you weather data/forecasts. Virtually all require API keys and most have limits on how fast you can pull data. The [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) is one we can recommend, as it's nice, quite accurate, and currently allows 1000 free API calls per day.**
